<h3 id="followup">Followup</h3>
<p>In my <a href="../haskell/2013/05/28/http-streams-and-aeson/">last post</a> there were (at least) a few things that could be done better. I got some great feedback from the smart people on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5801438">Hacker News</a> so I’ve made a couple changes to the final source.</p>
<p>The biggest issue is that I was completely <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5803731">losing the benefit of streaming</a> by reading the entire response body in and then parsing it. I knew this but as I mentioned I hadn’t yet figured out how to handle it correctly. Fortunately someone else does, and with their suggestions (and a bit more Googling) I figured it out. It could probably still be cleaned up a little but for these purposes it does the trick.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/joshrotenberg/5666409.js?file=HTTPStreamsAeson3.hs"> </script>

<p>On line 90 there is a new function called <code>parseJSONFromStream</code>. Calling this on the stream from <code>receiveResponse</code> (and adding the type hint for a <code>Result</code> wrapped around a <code>Feed</code>) gives us a similar situation as we had with <code>Maybe Feed</code>, so the main function does essentially the same thing still. With a little more time we could probably make this cleaner in <code>fetchQuakes</code> by giving the handler more to rather than calling it in a lambda.</p>
<p>And speaking of <code>fetchQuakes</code>, using http-streams’ <code>withConnection</code> cleans it up a little bit by automatically handling closing of the connection. It saves a couple lines of code and makes the function less cluttered.</p>
<p>Thanks again for all of the feedback!</p>
