<p>I found three dollar bills on the sidewalk yesterday. First I saw one, partially folded. I looked around quickly to see if anyone had obviously dropped it, and then snatched it up. As I righted myself, I saw the other two, together, folded in a similar manner. I looked around for more, but didn’t see any.</p>
<p>One time in high school I remember finding two crisp $20 bills among the fall leaves in the gutter in Providence. I was with my friend, Josh, and I remember how pissed he was that he didn’t find them. I think if that happened today, I’d give half to the person with me, but I’m pretty sure I didn’t do that then. I should have.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting phenomenon finding money on the street. One thing I noticed: I couldn’t help but look around for more. Even after finding the second two, I was somehow convinced that I’d find another one, or maybe a five or ten or even twenty dollar bill.</p>
