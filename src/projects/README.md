* [adrs](https://github.com/joshrotenberg/adrs)
  
  `adrs` is a [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) rewrite of the original [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) by
  [Nat Pryce](https://github.com/npryce). I was introduced to the [ADR](https://adr.github.io) methodology a few years ago.
  While ADR tooling isn't strictly needed (beyond git and a text editor), it does help with consistency and bookkeeping, and this
  has been a fun project to work on.
