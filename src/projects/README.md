# Projects

This is a brief list and explanation of personal projects I'm either currently working on or have
worked on in the past.

## Personal projects

### ~Active

* [adrs](https://github.com/joshrotenberg/adrs)
  
  `adrs` is a [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) rewrite of the original [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) by
  [Nat Pryce](https://github.com/npryce). I was introduced to the [Architectural Decision Records](https://adr.github.io) methodology a few years ago.
  While ADR tooling isn't strictly needed (beyond git and a text editor), it does help with consistency and bookkeeping, and this
  has been a fun project to work on.

### Not so active

* [lingua_ex](https://github.com/joshrotenberg/lingua_ex)

  [lingua](https://github.com/pemistahl/lingua) is a (human) language detection crate by [Peter M. Stahl](https://github.com/pemistahl).
  I wrapped it with [rustler](https://hex.pm/packages/rustler) to make the language detection API available in Elixir.
