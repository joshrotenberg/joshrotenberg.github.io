# About me

![me](img/me.jpeg)

My name is Josh Rotenberg. This is my personal site, built with [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook).

The picture above was just a quick headshot I took with a laptop for work. A coworker added a body of water behind me, and I tilted
it and added a filter. It just kind of stuck, so I use it now whenever I need a picture of me somewhere, which isn't all that often.
